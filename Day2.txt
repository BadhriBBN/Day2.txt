The PUT Method
PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.

The HEAD Method
HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body.

In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will make the same request but will not return the list of users.

HEAD requests are useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a GET request - like before downloading a large file or response body.

The DELETE Method
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

The PATCH Method
The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

The OPTIONS Method
The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.

The CONNECT Method
The CONNECT method is used to start a two-way communications (a tunnel) with the requested resource.

The TRACE Method
The TRACE method is used to perform a message loop-back test that tests the path for the target resource (useful for debugging purposes).
